## Question 1.
## Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
## Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission 
## from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
library(plyr)

NEI <- readRDS("../summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("../Source_Classification_Code.rds")

## Summarised NEI: Total emissions from 1999 to 2008
sNEI <- ddply(NEI, .(year), summarise, total = sum(Emissions))

## plot graph to png file
#png(filename = "plot1.png", width = 480, height = 480)
with(sNEI, barplot(total/10^6, names.arg = year, col = "blue",
                main = "Total emissions (1999 to 2008)",
                xlab = "Year", ylab = "PM2.5 Emissions"))
