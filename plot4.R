## Question 4.
## Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related 
## sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

# Find Coal combustion-related sources
coalSources <- SCC$SCC[grepl("coal", SCC$Short.Name, ignore.case = TRUE)]

## Summarised NEI: Total emissions from coal combustion-related sources accros the US (1999 - 2008)
